Making a basic rust cli tool.

The goal is to write a script that will generate a file structure
with the stadard file structure for a machine learning project.

The script will take in a name for the project and generate the
file structure with the name of the project as the root folder.

Files to be generated:
- README.md
- .gitignore (.env inside)
- .env
- requirements.txt
- data/
- data/raw/
- data/processed/
- models/
- notebooks/
- src/


This will change as I develop and remember more things that I need.
