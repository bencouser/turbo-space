# turbo-space

Making a basic rust cli tool.

The goal is to write a script that will generate a file structure
with the stadard file structure for a machine learning project.

The script will take in a name for the project and generate the
file structure with the name of the project as the root folder.

Files to be generated:
- README.md [x]
- .gitignore (.env inside) [x]
- .env [x]
- requirements.txt [x]
- data/ [x]
- data/raw/ [x]
- data/processed/ [x]
- models/ [x]
- notebooks/ [x]
- src/ [x]

Other Things to look into (in order of me caring)
- make input value for the name of the project []
- break main file into other files []
- prepopulate notebook files with basic packages []
- creating new env conda env with a set of default dependancies []



This will change as I develop and remember more things that I need.
